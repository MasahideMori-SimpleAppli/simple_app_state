State-first, explicit state management for Flutter.

SimpleAppState is a Flutter state management library designed for teams
that value **explicit state ownership, predictable rebuilds,
and long-term maintainability**.

> State is global and explicit.  
> Widgets declare which state they depend on.

## What makes it different?

SimpleAppState is built around three ideas:

- **Application state lives in one place** (`SimpleAppState`)
- **Widgets subscribe to state, but never own it**
- **Rebuilds are explicit and predictable**

There is no context-based lookup, no hidden dependency graph,
and no widget-owned application state.

## Tiny example

```dart
final appState = SimpleAppState();
final count = appState.slot<int>('count', initial: 0);

class CounterView extends SlotStatefulWidget {
  @override
  List<StateSlot> get slots => [count];

  @override
  State<CounterView> createState() => _CounterViewState();
}

class _CounterViewState extends SlotState<CounterView> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final value = count.get();
    return Text('Count: $value');
  }
}
```

Widgets rebuild only when their declared slots change.

---

## Who is this for?

SimpleAppState is especially suited for:

- Medium to large Flutter apps
- Teams with multiple developers
- Projects that need undo/redo, persistence, or testing
- Codebases where **“why did this rebuild?” must always be answerable**
